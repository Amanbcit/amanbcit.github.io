          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi there, my name is Amandeep, but most people call me Aman. I'm
            currently a full-stack developer in training at
            <strong>BCIT</strong>. I've always been passionate about building
            solutions with code — making computers do what most people can't.
            <br /><br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work across diverse
            industries, from fitness and construction to fiber optics. No matter
            where I was, my curiosity for the technology behind it all kept
            growing. <br /><br />
          </p>
          <p>
            After nearly a decade, I decided to follow that calling — because
            you only live once — and committed to building a career in software
            development. <br /><br />
